yo. get your own study notes lazy. That's the whole point of doing it the hard way.

One thing I immediately like about C is the convention of defining functions at the top of the file, no body just input/output types. Having coded a metric fuck-tonne of Python there have been times where the more elegant solution (in my mind) had functions arranged in a way that led to python reporting that that function didn't exist (but they did, just further down in the file). Javascript is more lenient, that's *define wherever as long as it's in scope*.
